# End User's IP Address

## Overview

Connections from Polaris to the origin server are established from Polaris IP addresses. To identify the IP address of
the end user within requests forwarded from the Polaris server, you need to extract this information through the Headers that Polaris adds to the requests.

In the example depicted, the IP address of the end user is `1.2.3.4`. When accessed directly without going through
Polaris, the origin server will receive a request with the IP address of `1.2.3.4`.

In cases where requests are forwarded from the Polaris server (for example, with IP `8.8.8.8`), the origin server will
receive the request with the IP address of Polaris, which is `8.8.8.8`. To extract the original IP address of the end
user (either `1.2.3.4` or `11.22.33.44`), users can utilize the headers added to the requests forwarded from the Polaris server.

## Identifying the IP Address of the End User

To identify the IP address of the end user, you can extract the information from one of the following headers within the requests sent from the Polaris server:

```
X-Forwarded-For xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
True-Client-IP  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
X-True-IP       xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```
