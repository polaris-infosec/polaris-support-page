# Content Security Policy (CSP) and CrossOrigin Resource Sharing (CORS) - what are they?

## Content Security Policy (CSP)

CSP is a browser mechanism that can help detect and prevent some common web attack types
such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

As most modern websites require dynamic content to be loaded, it is important that dynamically
generated content comes from legitimate sources. CSP allows you to specify legit sources and
only executes resources that are whitelisted in your CSP settings, ignoring other scripts and
assets that are not within the approved list.

CSP helps reduce and prevent attacks like XSS because it allows you to define what resources
are allowed and where the resources can be loaded from, preventing the browser from loading
resources from locations that may be malicious. It provides an extra layer of protection,
however, note that it does not prevent XSS by stopping malicious input from being rendered, but
rather mitigates it by telling the browser **not to execute** it because the rules define that it is not
from the right source. For example, if a malicious external script is loaded on the client-side, it
will trigger the CSP rule and block it from executing.

One of the many examples Polaris' CSP rule can help is through preventing JavaScript to be
executed inline, which is beneficial against XSS attacks because an attacker may try to execute
JavaScript in your web application.

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Traditionally, a website uses a same-origin policy. This policy ensures that your website's assets
cannot be accessed by another website. However, this is not feasible in most modern websites
that require resources to be loaded from external sources. Therefore, enforcing the same-origin
policy isn't always possible.

This is where Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) can be useful. CORS is applied via the
HTTP header and allows access to resources from a whitelisted domain.

CORS helps to control and customize your same-origin policy to serve certain content, which
can be used when you own multiple domains and require data sharing between them.

## Implementing CSP and CORS in Polaris

Polaris allows you to configure CSP and CORS policies in the settings and configurations for
each individual domain.

Polaris gives you the flexibility to use CSP and CORS to offer extra protection on your web
applications, easily turning them on and configuring them to your website's usage.

CSP and CORS are powerful security features. As a word of caution, it is recommended that
CSP and CORS be turned on only if the user knows what they are doing and the scenario calls
for it as false configurations can instead weaken a website's security, exposing it to more
vulnerabilities. This is not a feature that every user needs. Feel free to create an incident and
contact the Polaris team if any doubts arise in implementation.

You may implement CSP such that it only reports and does not block, keeping your website
functional while allowing you to test different CSP configurations. You may find out more about it [tại đây](../security-center/rules/csp).
