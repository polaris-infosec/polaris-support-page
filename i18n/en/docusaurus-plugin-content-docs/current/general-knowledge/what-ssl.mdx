# SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) - what is it?

## What is SSL?

SSL or Secure Sockets Layer is a common security technique used to secure communications
between the user and a web server. This prevents third parties from reading the
communications between the two parties. SSL is also known as TLS (Transport Layer Security).
Versions of this technique are used for websites, VOIP, emails and many other services online.

SSL is usually represented by a green lock on the address bar of the browser for the end user.

## Benefits of SSL

SSL has several benefits:

1.	Security: Prevents third parties from reading messages sent to and from the user and the
web server.
2.	Performance: SSL can also help to improve web page loading times.
3.	Trust: The green lock icon on the address bar increases a user's trust in the website.
