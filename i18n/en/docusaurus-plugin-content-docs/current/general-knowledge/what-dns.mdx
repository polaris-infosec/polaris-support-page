# Domain Name System (DNS) - what is it?

## What is DNS and why do we need it?

While your website may have a domain name such as "www.example.com", it is actually hosted
on an IP address which is a series of numbers serving as an identifier for your website. Every
device on the World Wide Web has a unique IP address, and it is this IP address that your
computer connects to when visiting a website. However, it is inconvenient for us to remember a
string of numbers, so instead, the Domain Name Servers (DNS) help to translate the domain
names into the relevant IP addresses. The DNS acts like a phonebook, storing both domain
names and their respective IP addresses. This checking and translating is done automatically
and usually very quickly.

*Example*: your website may be called www.yourpage.com but it has a corresponding IP address
of 111.222.33.44 which is the numerical identifier used by networks and servers to find your
website.

## Why should we use Polaris DNS?

By using Polaris Name Servers, you are introducing another layer of security to your website.
Polaris Name Servers will scan for potentially harmful requests and will redirect them away from
the website if found. This prevents several types of common attacks on your website while also
ensuring that your website's availability and accessibility for end users at all times.
