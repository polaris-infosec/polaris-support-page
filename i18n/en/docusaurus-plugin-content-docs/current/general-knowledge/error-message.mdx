## Polaris error messages:

**500 Internal Server Error**

A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more
specific message is suitable.

*Possible Solution*: Try again in a few minutes

**502 Bad Gateway**

The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the
upstream server.

*Possible Solution*: Try again in a few minutes

**503 Service Unavailable**

The server cannot handle the request (because it is overloaded or down for maintenance).
Generally, this is a temporary state.

*Possible Solution*: Try again in a few minutes

**504 Gateway Timeout**

The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and did not receive a timely response from the
upstream server.

*Possible Solution*: Check your origin server logs for clues as to what happened or visit a site that
is not going through Polaris. If the HTTP 504 error still occurs, the problem is on your side. If the
HTTP 504 error doesn't occur with another site you need to Whitelist Polaris IP addresses to
your origin web server.

**520 Web Server Returned an Unknown Error**

The origin server returned an empty, unknown, or unexpected response to Polaris.

*Possible Solution*: Host owners should contact Polaris for support.

**521 Web Server Is Down**
The origin server refused connections from Polaris. Security solutions at the origin may be
blocking legitimate connections from certain Polaris IP addresses.

*Possible Solution*: Host owners should contact Polaris for support.

**522 Connection Timed Out**

Polaris timed out contacting the origin server.

*Possible Solution*: Inform your domain host that your web server is not completing requests.
Something on your server may be using up resources.

**523 Origin Is Unreachable**

Polaris could not reach the origin server; for example, if the DNS records for the origin server
are incorrect or missing.

*Possible Solution*: Check your DNS settings. Confirm your origin IP and make sure your IP is
correctly listed in the Polaris DNS settings page.

**524 A Timeout Occurred**

Polaris was able to complete a TCP connection to the origin server, but did not receive a timely
HTTP response.

*Possible Solution*: A background application or database may be using up resources on your
web server. Check with your web host or development team to free up resources.

**525 SSL Handshake Failed**

Polaris could not negotiate a SSL/TLS handshake with the origin server.

*Possible Solution*: The SSL configuration used is not compatible with Polaris. Try using another.

**526 Invalid SSL Certificate**

Polaris could not validate the SSL certificate on the origin web server.

*Possible Solution*: The SSL certificate did not pass validation. It may be expired or does not
contain the requested domain name. Contact your host provider to check that a valid SSL
certificate is configured for this domain name on the origin server.

**527 Railgun Error**

Error 527 indicates an interrupted connection between Polaris and the origin server's Railgun
server.

*Possible Solution*: The issue is likely related to the website's Railgun listener configuration or the
host network. Test your connection from the Listener to the origin server or contact Polaris for
support.
