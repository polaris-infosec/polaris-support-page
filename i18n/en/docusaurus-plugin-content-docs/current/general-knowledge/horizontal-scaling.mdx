# Horizontal Scaling - what is it?

Many of the different ways the Polaris WAAP manages to maintain its own operations during a
DDoS attack, allowing you to then maintain your operations, is through Horizontal Scaling. As
the number of requests increase, flooding the WAAP, our servers automatically add new virtual
servers to help stand up to the workload. As the number of requests drops, those virtual servers
are then deactivated. This allows the WAAP to withstand certain types of volumetric DDoS
attacks. As the traffic passes through our WAAP, we then utilize methods such as Rate Limiting
and Load Balancing to distribute the traffic to your servers evenly to prevent flooding.
