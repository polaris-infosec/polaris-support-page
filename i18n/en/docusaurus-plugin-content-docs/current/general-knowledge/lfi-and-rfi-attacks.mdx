# LFI and RFI attacks - how to identify?

## LFI Detection

When preventing LFI (Local File Inclusion) attacks, Polaris attempts to detect if a malicious user
is trying to retrieve a file that is local to an organization's web server that they should not have
access to.

## RFI Detection

When detecting for RFI (Remote File Inclusion), Polaris attempts to detect if a malicious user is
trying to include a remote resource into the web application that will then be executed.

In both types of attacks, exploitation can lead to the web application and/or server being
compromised with resulting undesirable consequences.

Polaris determines if a request is malicious by considering the aggregated scoring of multiple
parameters, including but not limited to a combination of various rules, detection, and metrics
scores, which will then be fed into a machine learning algorithm.

Polaris also attempts to reduce and eliminate false positives by applying a dynamic score to the
request, request origin, and requested URI so that only actual threats are flagged for prevention
or subsequent investigation.

Currently, Polaris uses the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set to identify injected parts of the
query.
