# Security Center Overview

This article focuses on the overview page located in Polaris' Security Center. The overview page
is designed such that you are able to get a good insight on the security status of your site at one
glance, and easily navigate to its respective configuration page from it. To access it:

![Setting Tab](/img/security-center/overview/settings-tab.png)

Under `Sites`, click on `Security Center`

The default page of `Overview` should load up, this is the overview page. The page is split into 2
sections, Site Statistics, and Quick Settings.

## Site Statistics

The site statistics table gives an overview of how the site is doing and displays if there are any
unresolved incidents.

## Incidents

- Total number of incidents
- Number of open and in triage incidents out of total incidents categorized by **severity**
- Statistics about traffic and requests displayed in 2 columns - **Today** & **This Month**
- A **'Notice'** or **'Attention Needed'** warning is shown when there are incidents that are Open
or in Triage. Refer to the annotations in the image above for more information.

## Threat Intelligence

The figures display the number of:

- Total Detected Threats
- Suspicious IPs
- Compromised Data
- Phishing Sites

Similar to Incidents, Polaris will also display a **Notice** or **Attention Needed** alert when Polaris
picks up information from its threat intelligence feeds and functions.

A **Notice** alert is displayed when Polaris detects suspicious IP addresses.

An **Attention Needed** alert is displayed when Polaris finds compromised data belonging to your
site and/or potential phishing sites similar to your domain.

## Quick Settings

This menu allows you to turn on/off some security features of Polaris. There are 3 of them:

1. Behavior Learning Mode

- (To find out more about this mode, refer to [this](behavior-learning-mode) article)

2. Under Attack Mode

- Turning on this mode displays a Javascript challenge for users visiting the site:

![Show Verify](/img/security-center/overview/under-attack-mode-verify.png)
Visitors must pass simple challenge(s) before accessing the site.

Polaris will display a hCaptcha challenge that requires users to solve before accessing the site,
this can help keep out bots and spam because these questions are easy for humans and difficult
for machines. To find out more about hCaptcha and what it does, visit [their site](https://www.hcaptcha.com/).

3. Edge Caching

- Turning on Edge Caching will let Polaris cache static content on your site so users can
access static content faster.

Static content is not dynamically generated and appears the same for every visitor to your site,
therefore it can be stored at an edge server to reduce loading time. These edge servers usually
exist at the 'edge' of a network, this keeps content close to the client thus reducing latency in
accessing these contents. The benefits of doing this are reducing the bandwidth of your origin
servers and reducing page loading speed for the visitor.

## Other settings

You may also view information about other settings here:
