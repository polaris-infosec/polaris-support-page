# Service Monitor

Polaris allows you to monitor your resources and ensure that key resources are always available
and accessible at all times. This function is compatible with any resource that can be accessed
through a URL and is highly customizable to suit your needs.

## Accessing Service Monitor

![Setting Tab](/img/security-center/overview/settings-tab.png)

![Service Monitor Tab](/img/security-center/service-monitor/service-monitor-tab.png)

Look for `Service Monitor` on the horizontal sliding menu.

## Adding a resource

To add a resource, click the `+ Service Monitor` button and fill in the necessary details:

![Add Service](/img/security-center/service-monitor/add-service.png)

1.	Set a **Service Name** to identify the resource.
2.	Select the **Service Type: HTTP / TCP / UDP / ICMP / gRPC**
3.	Pick the duration of the **check interval**. It ranges anywhere from 30 seconds to 1800
seconds.
4.	Enter the resource to be monitored and note any other necessary details.

*For HTTP*: Enter the **HTTP Status Code** & select the **service check type (GET / POST /DELETE / PATCH / PUT)**
HTTP Headers & Expected Response are optional.

*For TCP & UDP*: Enter the port number

*For ICMP & GCRP*: No additional details needed.

5.	Pick the duration of **request timeout** which ranges anywhere from 1 second to 180 seconds.

For example, if the **check interval** is 30 seconds and the **request timeout** is 5 seconds, Polaris
will probe the resource every 30 seconds, and if the expected response is received within 5
seconds, the resource is considered to be online. If not, it will be reflected as downtime and
marked as offline.

Polaris displays the following information for monitoring a resource:

1.	Average Response time
2.	% of uptime in the past 24 hours
3.	% of uptime in the past 7 days
4.	Graph displaying response time and uptime in detail

The graph can be customized:

-	Range of date displayed

-	Size of the graph (Zoom In/Out)
