# 4. Zero Trust Access (ZTA) - Users

Users will be added when you create your Groups, and then will show up in the Users tab. Of
note, just because users of your organization have access to the WAAP platform do not mean
they have ZTA permissions. Enterprise customers are provisioned with 15 free users, however
customers of other packages will need to upgrade to ZTA to use this feature.
