# 1. Zero Trust Access (ZTA) Overview

## Zero Trust Access

Polaris Zero Trust Access (ZTA) feature is designed to provide more control over applications as
users can provision a login system to existing applications so that all access is first verified and
authorized. Essentially, in order to access an application, such as a dev website which may not
be publicly facing, the ZTA feature adds a login function so that authorized users must first be
authenticated. It adds an additional layer of security to any necessary applications.

Enterprise customers are provided with 15 free ZTA users. Customers on other plans may
upgrade to use this feature or purchase individual user seats.

In order to add Zero Trust Access:
1.	Choose the Provider you want for Single Sign On (SSO) services - Google or Microsoft Azure
2.	Create a Group to determine who will have access to the ZTA services (Users will then be
listed under the Users tab)
3.	Add your Application
4.	Edit your theme, or configure your callback URL

-	**Providers**

    ZTA uses 3rd-party providers to manage user authentication and authorization via SSO.
    These providers are pre-configured OAuth 2.0 applications so users only need OAuth
    credentials to set up a new provider. Currently, Polaris supports Azure Active Directory and
    Google Cloud Platform. [Read more](add-providers).
-	**Groups**

    Groups determine which users can access protected endpoints based on their
    organization roles or departments. It allows access to applications in mass without having to individually add
    users to certain applications. Groups are based on `Email` or `Email
    Domain` and customized by the Organization's admin for ZTA. Users will find it easy to add
    or remove people in your groups. [Read more](add-groups).
-	**Users**

    In order to manage who accesses your applications, the users list serves to control who
    has permissions. Just because a user is added to your organization to view and manage
    the WAAP, does not automatically enroll them in the ZTA users list. Under the Users tab
    you can add, view, or revoke ZTA members anytime. Users are actually added to the ZTA
    list when you create your groups. [Read more](users).
-	**Applications**

    Application access is established by providers such as Google or Microsoft via Single-Sign
    On (SSO) so that all it takes is a click of a button for secure validation. The list of users
    who may have access to these applications is also established via the Zero Trust Access
    feature. This feature also supports subdomains and paths. To learn how to add
    applications to utilize the ZTA features,  [read more](add-applications).
-	**Login Page Configuration**

    We made a simple and clean login page for users with an on-demand theme editor for
    customization to your organization. You can also preview your login page before saving
    any changes. [Read more](login-theme).
-	**Custom Access Domain**

    Currently, our domain [polarisaccess.com](https://polarisaccess.com/)  is the default access point to your web
    application, where the login screen is maintained, but you absolutely can replace it with
    your own domain. Remember that you need to first change a few settings to use your
    custom access domain. [Read more](custom-access-domain).
