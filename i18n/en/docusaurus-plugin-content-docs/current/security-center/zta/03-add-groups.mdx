# 3. Zero Trust Access (ZTA) - Add Groups

## GENERAL

Creating Groups allows you to sort your users so that you don't have to individually add them to
applications and can instead add them by roles or departments. All your groups will be shown
under the Groups menu under Zero Trust Access. This is also where you'll be able to add new
users that may access your chosen ZTA applications.
