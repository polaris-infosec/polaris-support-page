existing logins for any applications that you want to employ ZTA for. By adding a provider that you
already have login information for, you can now login with the click of a button which is called called
Single-Sign On (SSO) access. You can see any providers you have already added under the Providers
menu in the Zero Trust Access section of your organization.
