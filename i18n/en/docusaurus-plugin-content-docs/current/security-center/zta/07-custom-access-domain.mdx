# 7. Zero Trust Access (ZTA) - Custom Access Domain

A part of the Zero Trust Access feature is allowing for a customized access domain so that
authorized users can log into your zero trust applications. Within the Zero Trust settings, you'll
find this option under the Configuration tab.

**Note**:

If using your custom access domain:
-	You need to add a CNAME record that points your new access domain to **the custom domain name**.
-	You must use Polaris DNS for your custom access domain:
o	You must enable the **Firewall** in **DNS Settings** for that record.
