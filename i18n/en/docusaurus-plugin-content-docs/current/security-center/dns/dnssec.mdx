# DNSSEC

## What is DNSSEC?

DNSSEC adds an additional authentication layer onto existing [DNS](dns-record) architecture. On its own,
DNS is insecure and prone to on-path attacks or other types of DNS forgery attacks. Enabling
DNSSEC ensures that your visitors will access your site when entering your domain in their web
browser, and not be redirected to forged websites.


## Enabling DNSSEC in Polaris
DNSSSEC can be enabled in the `DNS` tab of a website's settings page on Polaris

Once DNSSEC has been enabled, you will be shown a series of records which should be added
to your domain registrar. Common examples of domain registrars are
[GoDaddy](https://ph.godaddy.com/help/add-a-ds-record-23865),
[Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9722/2232/managing-dnssec-for-domains-pointed-to-custom-dns/)
and [Google Domains](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/6147083?hl=en&visit_id=638205977536883713-2000001299&rd=1#zippy=%2Ccustom-name-servers)
(refer to the Custom Name servers option). Please
follow the instructions on your registrars' knowledge base to configure these settings. Do note
that any misconfiguration will result in your website becoming inaccessible.

Once you have added the records to your registrar, it might take up to an hour for the changes
to be reflected on Polaris. The status of the setup will then be changed to DNSSEC enabled and
you are done with the DNSSEC setup.
