The `proxied` switch will enable Polaris protection to those servers. However, it is not
recommended to turn on this protection for servers which do not run on ports 80 or 443 such as
mail servers or FTP. For all other servers, it is recommended that you turn on protection.

To delete a record, click the `Bin` icon under the Actions column. If you would like to edit a
record, remove the old record and add a new one.
