rule contains the rule's name, condition, and action to take based on the rule's condition.

You can customize your new rule here.

These parameters help you customize your rule:

1.	**Rule name**: A specific name to distinguish your rule from other rules.

2.	**Determining Rule Conditions**
    a. **Parameters to check**. When the request comes in, Polaris checks the information that matches this parameter, the available parameters are:

          -	AS Num
          -	Cookie
          -	Country
          -	Hostname

          -	User Agent
          -	Threat Score (Threat scale from 1 to 100)

    b. **Operator**. The operator determines how Polaris compares the selected parameter, the available options are:

        -   equals
        -	does not equal
        -	is in
        -	is not in

        -	less than
        -	greater than or equal to
        -	less than or equal to

    c. **Value**: Specify the value for the parameter and operator to compare.

    d. **Logic function**. This function can be used to customize the rule to make it more precise because it allows you to add a parameter,
     operator and another operator value in the same rule. However, the use of logical functions is optional, functions that can
     available is:

        -	**AND**: to match other conditions / all in the same rule.
        -	**OR**: to match at least one of many conditions in the same rule.

3. **Action taken by Polaris**. This determines the appropriate part for Polaris to perform if the parameter,
operator and operator value match, the following available actions are:

-	**Allowed**: Polaris allows requests to be forwarded for processing and response.
-	**Blocked**: request denied and response with status code HTTP 403 (Forbidden).
-	**JS Challenged**: Polaris will run a JavaScript validation challenge before users can view the content.
-	**Challenged (Captcha)**: Polaris will show Captcha challenge before user can view the content.
-	**Log**: Polaris will post it as a security event if it matches the custom rule action.
-	**Redirect**: Polaris redirects web traffic to another server.
-	**Rewrite URI**: Polaris updates a specific section of the URI with new information.
