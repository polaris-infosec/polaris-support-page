## What is OWASP?

The Open Web Application Security Project is a foundation that publishes the top 10 most
common web cyber attacks. The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is a set of generic
attack detection rules which help prevent these attacks.

## What does this setting do?

This setting enables the CRS mentioned above. The exact rules are described on the settings
page itself. Polaris automatically enables protection against these attacks. However, if you
would like to turn them off for testing purposes, it can be done by using the switch in this section.
