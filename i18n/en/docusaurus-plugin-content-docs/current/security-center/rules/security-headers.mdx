# Security Headers

## What are security headers?

Security headers are HTTP headers which are set in the responses sent from the origin server
to the visitor. These headers define the behaviour of the browser when viewing the webpage
and help to prevent common attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Click jacking, or code
injection.

Polaris simplifies the configuration of these HTTP headers by letting you choose which settings
you would like and handling the technical implementation automatically.

## Accessing Security Headers in Polaris

![Setting Tab](/img/security-center/overview/settings-tab.png)

Click on `Settings` of your site.

Click on `Rules` (red arrow) then `Security Headers` (green arrow) to access it.

## What headers can you set with Polaris?

Polaris helps to configure several security headers. Each of them help against a specific type of
attack, however they can also cause problems with the functionality of the website in some
cases. Please ensure that your webpage is able to function as intended with the settings in
place. The following are the security headers Polaris helps configure:

### Referrer Policy

When a browser goes from one page to another, it includes the address of its originating page in
a HTTP header called the referrer. This occurs even when the browser goes to another domain,
possibly leaking information of the referrer to an untrustworthy domain. To prevent this, you can
use the Referrer-Policy HTTP header to declare your website's policy on withholding referrer
information. The options for this setting are as follows:

1.	`Off`: The Referrer header will be omitted entirely. No referrer information is sent along
with requests.
2.	`No referrer`: The Referrer header will be omitted entirely. No referrer information is sent
along with requests.
3.	`No referrer when downgrade`: Send the origin, path, and query string in the Referrer
header when the protocol security level stays the same or improves. Don't send the
Referrer header for requests to less secure destinations.
4.	`Origin`: Send only the origin in the Referrer header, i.e. when the Referrer is
example.com/example1/example2 only example.com will be sent.
5.	`Origin when cross origin`: Send the origin, path, and query string when performing a
same-origin request to the same protocol level. Send only the origin for cross-origin requests and requests to less
secure destinations. Cross-origin requests occur when the browser brings you to a website from a different origin.
6.	`Same origin`: Send the origin, path, and query string for same-origin requests. Doesn't
send the Referrer header for cross-origin requests.
7.	`Strict origin`: Send only the origin when the protocol security level stays the same.
Doesn't send the Referrer header to less secure destinations.
8.	`Strict origin when cross origin` (default): Send the origin, path and query string when
performing a same origin request. For cross-origin requests send only the origin when the
protocol level stays the same. Doesn't send the Referrer header to less
secure designations.
9.	`Unsafe url`: Send the origin, path, and query string when performing any request,
regardless of security.

### Click Jacking

Polaris protects against click jacking by implementing the X-Frame-Options header. This
prevents attackers from hijacking objects on your website and tricking visitors into clicking them.
The options available are as follows:

1.	`Off`: Tiêu đề không được thiết lập
2.	`No content within frame`: The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so.
3.	`Allow content within frame from same origin`: The page can only be displayed in a
frame on the same origin as the page itself. The exact implementation of this differs from
browser to browser.
4.	`Allow content within frame from specific origin`: A page can be displayed in a frame
only on the specified origin URL.

### XSS (Cross Site Scripting)

An attacker uses XSS to inject malicious content into a request between the browser and the
origin server. A server may execute the malicious script if it does not sanitise the HTML query
parameters. Polaris uses the X-XSS-Protection header to prevent this from occurring. The
options available for this header are as follows:

1.	`Off`: Disables XSS filtering.
2.	`Sanitise script`: Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the
browser will sanitise the page by removing the unsafe parts.
3.	`Block script`: Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitising the page, the browser will
prevent the rendering of the page if an attack is detected.

### Mime Sniffing

To guard against arbitrary uploads to your webpage, Polaris uses the X-Content-Type-Options
header. This disables the browser's MIME sniffing capabilities and demands that a browser uses
the original MIME type of a file as defined by its source. The options available for this header
are:

1.	`Off`: Header is not set.
2.	`No sniff`: Blocks a request if the request destination is of type `style` and the MIME
type is not `text/css` , or if it is of type `script` and the MIME type is not a JavaScript
MIME type. It enables Cross-Origin Read Blocking (CORB) protection for the following
MIME types:

    a.	text / html

    b.	text / plain

    c.	text / json

    d.	application / json or any other type with a JSON extension: * / * + json

    e.	text / xml, application / xml or any other type with an XML extension: * / * + xml (excluding image / svg + xml)

At the bottom of the Security Headers tab, you will be able to see the overview of all the security
headers which will be applied to the responses from your origin server.
