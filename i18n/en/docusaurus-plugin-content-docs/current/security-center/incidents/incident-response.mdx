# Incident Response & Ticket Management

In Polaris, **Incident Response** can be conducted and managed by an organization's internal
team members via a ticket system. Tickets can be used to monitor, alert, and discuss threats
that are present on the site, helping you focus on the threats that matter and mitigate them
within the shortest time possible.

**Note**: incident response will be conducted by an organization's own team unless they are part of
Polaris' Managed Security Services program.

There are 2 ways a user can **create an incident ticket**:

1.	 Through a **Security Events**. To find out more about security events and how you can use it to
create incidents, check out this article: [Security Events](security-events).
2.	Creating an incident ticket individually without the use or reference of an existing security
event.
