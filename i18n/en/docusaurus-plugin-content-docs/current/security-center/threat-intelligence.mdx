# Threat Intelligence Overview

Polaris' Threat Intelligence feature provides valuable information about potential threats to your website. These
features allow you to take action against the early stages of an attack or attacks in progress but you may not realize it.

There are 4 features in Polaris' threat intelligence function that you can use:
1.	Suspicious IPs
2.	Compromised Data
3.	Phishing
4.	Server Vulnerability

To access Threat Intelligence tab:

![Security Center Tab](/img/security-center/incident-response/security-center-tab.png)

Under `SITES`, select your domain and click on `Settings`.

![Threat Intelligence Tab](/img/security-center/threat-intelligence/threat-intelligence-tab.png)

Looking at the horizontal tab, click `Threat Intelligence`.

## 1.	Suspicious IPs:

If Polaris detects any IP address with suspicious behavior or spamming your site, it will be listed as a suspicious IP
address. From here, there are 2 possible actions:

a.	**Create incident**: Clicking on the `+ CREATE INCIDENT` action will allow you to create an incident and alert other
users on your team to investigate. To learn more about creating issues and responses in Polaris,
see this article: [Incident Response & Ticket Management](incidents/incident-response).

b.	**Allow IP to Whitelist or Blacklist**. Click on the 3 dots to the right of the create problem button to bring up
the option to whitelist and blacklist suspicious IP addresses. Whitelisting the IP will assume it is a secure IP
address while blacklisting it will block any requests from it next time.

To evaluate and prioritize suspicious IP addresses, a hazard rating will also be provided based on known IP information
that is matched against third-party frameworks and databases, as well as other behaviors. motion is tested.

## 2.	Compromised Data

Polaris automatically monitors the web and known data leaks on a daily basis to look for compromised information that
may be related to your website, such as compromised email addresses and passwords. offense.

If Polaris detects compromised information regarding your domain, you will be alerted by email and it will be displayed
on the dashboard along with any known leak sources. The WAAP platform is not capable of doing anything with compromised
data other than reporting it, however, once you become aware of it, you can take action for your organization.
Mitigation steps could include forcing an organization's password change, notifying team members, partners or customers
of the data leak, and remediation of security protocols.

## 3.	Phishing

Polaris automatically checks daily for domains that are similar to your registered domain name and reports it under the phishing tab:

![Phishing Tab](/img/security-center/threat-intelligence/phishing-tab.png)

There are various actions and features you can use to investigate and respond to a potential phishing attempt:
-	**Green info icon (as indicated by red arrow above)**: Clicking on it opens a new tab on [whois.com](https://www.whois.com/whois/)
to reveal more information about the domain
-	**Click on the domain name** will open a new tab to the site, which will help you determine if it is a phishing
attempt to target your site. If not, click the screenshot to see a screenshot of the web page.
-	The **matching** column reveals how Polaris thinks about that site's similarity to yours. A very low match rate
marked with an "Irrelevant" tag is less likely to be a scam attempt.
-	**Địa chỉ IP** và **Ngày đăng ký** của tên miền cũng được liệt kê.
-	In the action column, the `+ Create Incident` option (as indicated by the green arrow in the image above) allows you
to create an incident to notify your team for review and investigation. For more information on incident reporting and
response, refer to this [article](incidents/incident-response).
-	Alternatively, if you determine that the domain name is not a phishing threat, you can mark it as '**Resolved**' by
accessing the kebab menu (3 dots) as indicated by the green arrow in the image above. Note that once a domain is
resolved, this action cannot be reversed.

If your investigation of the phishing domain determines that it is indeed a threat, further actions may include
contacting the domain owner to flag the site and warn team members, partners and customers about the fake site so
they can avoid it.

## 4.	Server Vulnerability

Polaris integrates a third-party scanning engine that scans your web servers and lists detected services with potential
vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Vulnerabilities are mapped to **CVE frames**.

Clicking `View` for the server will display the information:

![server Vulnerability Tab](/img/security-center/threat-intelligence/server-vulnerability-tab.png)

-	The service name, port and instance running on the server will be displayed.
-	Any potential vulnerabilities in the services running on the server are also listed against the National Vulnerability
Database (NVD). Each vulnerability in the NVD can be uniquely identified by its '**CVEID**', clicking on it will open a
new tab to show more information about it.

Threat Intelligence is offered as an integrated service to Enterprise customers, but may be an additional feature for
other Polaris plans.
