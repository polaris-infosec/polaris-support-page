# SSL Configuration

This setting can be found under the SSL tab in your website settings.

To access `Settings`, click the drop-down menu on the selected site:

Under `SITES`, select your domain and click on `Settings`.

## Origin to Edge Server Settings

Firstly, we will be choosing how to secure the connection between the Polaris servers (Edge
Servers) and your website (Origin Server). The three options are (also shown in the image
above):

-	**Off**: Disables connections made via HTTPS. If users attempt to connect via HTTPS they
will receive a HTTP 301 redirect to plaintext HTTP. This is **Not Recommended**.
-	**Flexible**: Connections made to the edge servers will always be HTTPS but the connection
from the edge server to your website will be made with HTTP.
-	**Full**: : Connections will follow the user's scheme. If the user connects to the edge server
with HTTPS, the connection to the website will be through SSL/TLS, otherwise, it will be
HTTP.

## Always use HTTPS

Next, choose if you would like to always enable HTTPS. This setting would ensure that users
accessing your website will always be connecting through HTTPS, which is more secure. If you
are using WordPress, you have to take some additional steps as seen in this article: [HTTPS for WordPress](https://make.wordpress.org/support/user-manual/web-publishing/https-for-wordpress/).

## Edge Certificates

Finally, if you have any edge certificates you would like to add, please import them in the PEM
format. This can be done through the **Add Certificate** button which will let you upload the
necessary files.


***Note***: When users upload an SSL certificate, Polaris always uses this certificate, even if it has expired. Polaris does not automatically replace it with an SSL certificate generated by Polaris. This means that users must manage the lifecycle of the certificate themselves.
