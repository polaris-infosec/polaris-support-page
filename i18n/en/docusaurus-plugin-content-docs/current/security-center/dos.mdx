# DoS Protection & Rate Limiting

## What are DoS attacks?

Distributed Denial of Service (DoS) attacks usually consist of a large number of requests to your
website made by bots. This can result in server lag, your website becoming unreachable due to
the bandwidth allocated to your website being consumed by the useless traffic as opposed to
your actual viewers.

Polaris' DoS defense allows for the protection of your web application across Layers
7. Layer 7 defense is controlled via Rate Limiting, set by platform configuration settings.

## What is Rate Limiting?

Rate limiting is the process in which the amount of requests to your web server within a set
amount of time is controlled. That means that when a DoS attack happens, instead of all the
traffic flooding your servers at once, the WAAP acts as a traffic control guard, allowing only a
certain amount to reach your server at a time.

DoS Rate Limiting can be found under the `Policies` tab in your website settings, to access
`Settings`, click the drop-down menu on the selected site:

Under `Sites`, go to `Settings`

## Configuration

Click on the `Policies` Tab to access configure DoS protection via Rate Limiting. See
configurations belows:

![Policies Tab](/img/security-center/ddos/policies-tab.png)

There are two categories of DoS protection, **global** and **client**:

-	**Global** protection sets the threshold for number of connections from any sources to the
server.
-	**Client** protection sets the threshold for number of connections from any one particular
user to the server.

There are two settings for each category, **domain** threshold and **burst** threshold which will limit
the rate (Rate Limiting) at which requests may be made to your web application:

-	**Domain** threshold refers to the minimum number of requests over a period of 10 seconds
before DoS protection is activated. This helps to identify DoS attacks where requests
slowly increase in number over a longer period of time. Minimum value: 5000
-	**Burst** threshold refers to the minimum number of requests over a period of 5 seconds,
before DoS protection is activated. This helps to identify DoS attacks where there is a
sudden increase in requests in a short period of time. Minimum Value: 1000

Do note that there are minimum values for each field and that these are the default settings for
DoS protection. Once the relevant changes have been made, be sure to press the
blue **Update** button to save your changes.

In addition to **Rate Limiting**, Polaris also utilizes **horizontal scaling**, its **Anycast network**, and
[Load Balancing](../general-knowledge/load-balancing) to distribute traffic in mitigation of DoS attacks.
