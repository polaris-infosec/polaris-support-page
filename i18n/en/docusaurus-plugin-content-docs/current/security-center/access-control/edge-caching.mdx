# Edge Caching

## What is edge caching?

Edge caching saves large files from websites onto caching servers, in this case on the Polaris
edge servers. With edge caching enabled, visitors visiting your websites will load files from our
servers instead of your website directly, reducing the load times and also reducing the load on
your webpage.

## What does Polaris offer?

Polaris users can enable Edge Caching to improve their page load times. The Polaris servers
refresh the caches every two hours and also help cache over 30 types of files for your web
pages. Please refer to the section below for the types of files cached.

Polaris also has the option of clearing all existing caches and updating the cache immediately.
This is done through the clear cache option.

## How to enable edge caching

To enable edge caching, choose a specific website you would like to apply it to and go to its
`Settings` tab.

Under `SITES`, select your domain and click on `Settings`.

In the `General Settings` tab, on the right side of the page under `Quick Actions`, click the
corresponding switch to turn on edge caching.

You also have the option to Clear Cache.

If you would like to remove all existing cached files on the Polaris servers and update them
again, you are able to do that with the clear cache option.
