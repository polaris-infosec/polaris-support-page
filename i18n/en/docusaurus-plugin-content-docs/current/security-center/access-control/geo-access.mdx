# GEO Access

## What is GEO Access?

GEO Access restricts access to your website based on geographical location. You can allow or
block all visitors from certain countries.

The GEO Access setting can be found in the `Access Control` tab of your website's settings.

To access `Settings`, click the drop-down menu on the selected site:

Under `SITES`, select your domain and click on `Settings`.

## How do I enable GEO Access?

Under the `Access Control` tab select the `GEO Access` option. Set the switch to `ON`.

![Turn On Geo Access](/img/security-center/access-control/geo-access-turn-on.png)

You will see a list of countries with switches to allow or block access to your website. By default,
when the GEO Access option is first turned on, all countries will be allowed access. To prevent
access to a certain country: Search for the country in the search bar and set the switch to off.

There are also options to allow access from all countries or block access from all countries.

If you would only like to allow access to your website from a few countries, first use the **Block
All** option to remove access from all countries. Then, search and allow access for the countries
you would like to allow access to.
