# Blacklisting an IP Address

## What is blacklisting?

There are two ways of restricting access to your website, allowing all traffic except for certain
specified IP addresses (Blacklisting) or only allowing specified IP addresses ([Whitelisting](whitelist-ip)).

The Blacklist IP Address setting can be found in the `Access Control` tab of your website's
settings.

To access `Setting`, head to the drop-down menu of the selected site:

![Setting Tab](/img/security-center/overview/settings-tab.png)

Under `SITES`, select your domain and click on `Settings`.

## How do I blacklist a website?

Look for the `Access Control` tab, followed by the `Blacklist IP Addresses` setting:

![Blacklist Ip Tab](/img/security-center/access-control/blacklist-ip-blacklist-ip-tab.png)

Simply enter the IP address you would like to white list in the xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx format and click
the Blacklist option to add.

## Removing blacklisted websites

You can also remove existing blacklisted sites from this page.
