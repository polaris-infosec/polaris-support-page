# Whitelisting an IP Address

## What is whitelisting?

There are two ways of restricting access to your website, allowing all traffic except for certain
specified IP addresses ([Blacklisting](blacklist-ip)) or only allowing specified IP addresses (Whitelisting).

## How do I whitelist a website?

The Whitelist IP Address setting can be found in the `Access Control` tab of your website's
settings.

To access `Settings`, click the drop-down menu on the selected site:

![Setting Tab](/img/security-center/overview/settings-tab.png)

Under `SITES`, select your domain and click on `Settings`.

Look for the `Access Control` tab in Settings:

![Whitelist Ip Tab](/img/security-center/access-control/whitelist-ip-whitelist-ip-tab.png)

Select `Whitelist IP Address` in the `Access Control Tab`. Simply enter the IP address you would
like to white list in the xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx format and click the whitelist option.

## Removing whitelisted websites

You can also remove existing whitelisted sites from this page:

Simply select the IP Addresses you would like to remove from the whitelist and click the delete
option (as shown above).
