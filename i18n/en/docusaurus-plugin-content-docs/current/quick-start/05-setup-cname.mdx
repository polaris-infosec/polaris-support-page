# Setting up with a CNAME Record

**Setting up with your CNAME is one of two ways in which you can register your web domain for protection with
Polaris' WAAP. This is the advanced method and most users will register via the Nameservers method.**

Once registered for the WAAP, the setup wizard will automatically take you through the following
steps.

### Step 1: Verifying your domain:

This step would have to be accomplished in your DNS provider which is the company that
maintains your web services. Please refer to your DNS provider's FAQs or knowledge base on
how to add a TXT record.

The above image is from adding a TXT record on the Polaris webpage. It should look similar on
your DNS provider's page as well. Create a record with the following settings:

- Choose `Record Type` to be TXT
- Leave the `Name` field blank or with `@`
- For the `Text` field, please copy and paste the value shown on the Setup Wizard
- Set the TTL as automatic

These settings may not appear in the specified order, so please enter the respective values into
the correct fields.

This verification process may take up to a day to complete. Once verification is done, you should
receive an email and you would be able to continue with the Setup Wizard.

### Step 2: Origin Server

In this step you will be adding the IP addresses of your website servers (also known as the
Origin Servers).

Click the blue `Add Server` button, this will popup another window where you can enter your IP
address. If you have multiple origin servers, please repeat this server several times.

If you made any errors while adding the origin server, remove the server with the remove option
and add it again. When you have added all your origin servers, click the blue `Next` button at
the bottom of the screen.

### Step 3: Domain Configuration

In this step you will be configuring your domains to connect to Polaris. To do this you can add
either A or CName records.

![Domain Config](/img/quick-start/setup-cname-domain-config.png)

Choose the respective record type, enter its name into the `Name` field and select which origin
server the record belongs to from the dropdown list. The dropdown list will contain origin servers
added in step 2. You can also remove any records added wrongly with the `Remove` button in
the action column of the table.

Once the record has been added Polaris will check and verify your domain config, this will take a
while. You can check by logging in later, or with the `Re-Check Now` button. You can still
proceed to the next step even if it has not been verified.


### Step 4: Additional Steps

You are done with the initial setup for your website. There are now several other settings you can now
configure
