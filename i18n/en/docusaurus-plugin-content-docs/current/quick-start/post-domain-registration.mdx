# Post-Domain Registration Access Issues

If you continue having problems accessing your page after domain registration on the Polaris WAAP,
such as seeing a 504 Error, please try resolving issues via:

1. Adding **Polaris IP addresses** do your domain origin server’s whitelists. This should be a settings
function in your domain host. You can find IP addresses to be added here:

a. [Polaris IP Addresses](ip-addresses)

2. Adjust your **SSL settings** from “Flexible” to “Full” under the domain’s settings in the WAAP platform.
