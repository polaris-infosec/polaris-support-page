# How does Polaris protect your website?

## What does Polaris do?

Polaris provides DNS security and monitors traffic accessing your website for any malicious activities. This protects
your websites from various types of attacks, including those on the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
List as well as DDoS attacks. Polaris is extremely customisable and you can tailor the various settings to suit your needs.

## What happens when a visitor connects to your website?

When a user's browser sends a request to your website, the request is sent via the internet to
Polaris Edge Servers. There, our systems inspects the request for any malicious content which
could be used to execute XSS attacks or other forms of injection. If your website has specific
plug-ins, you are also able to configure Polaris to screen HTTP requests to those plug-in API
endpoints.

Once it has been deemed safe, the request is sent to your website (Origin Server) where it will
be processed. Similarly, the response is sent to our Edge Server before it is sent to the visitor.
This way, the Origin Server IP will not be known to the visitor.

You are able to configure how Polaris reacts and responds to requests, and effectively use
Polaris to mitigate and prevent threats that can affect your website.
