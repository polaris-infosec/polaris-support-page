# Setting up with Nameservers

**Setting up with Nameservers is one of two ways in which you can register your web domain for protection with
Polaris' WAAP. This is the recommended method for most users as the CNAME method is more advanced.**

To register your web domain with the Nameserver option, the setup wizard will guide you through these steps following registration.

### Step 1: Verifying DNS records

Polaris automatically adds your DNS records based on our analysis of your website. Please
verify them and if there are any missing, please enter them manually according to [this article](../security-center/dns/dns-record).

If you would like to import or export your DNS records, this can also be done via
the **Import** and **Export** buttons. Do note that the file format for both import and export is .TXT.
Also note that these records can also be edited later.

Once you are done, click the `Next` button.

### Step 2: Verifying Nameservers

In this step, you will be transferring your nameservers from your domain registrars to Polaris.
Some examples of domain registrars include GoDaddy, Wix.com and Namecheap, companies
that host your website on the internet.

As per the instructions on the setup wizard, you will first have to login to your registrar website
and remove the mentioned nameservers. If you have difficulties, please refer to the registrar's
FAQ site. Once that is done, add the ones shown on screen, copying and pasting the
information will do.

Save the changes made and the rest of the process will be automated. When the changes have
been completed and the nameservers have been transferred to Polaris, you will receive a
confirmation email. You can also use the **re-check now** on the wizard to check if the transfer
has been done successfully.

When you are done with this step (you do not need to wait for the confirmation email) please
click the `Next` button.


### Step 3: Additional Steps

You are done with the initial setup for your website. There are now several other settings you
can now configure.
